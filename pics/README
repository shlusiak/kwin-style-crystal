These are the button themes for Crystal.

1) embedtool: Tool wich converts the png files into C-source code. The source files are then included in the decoration source.
Use with 'embedtool file1 file2 > tiles.h', or 'embedtool foo/*.png > bar.h'.


2) The button themes are handled by cmake. Please see file $top_src/client/CMakeLists.txt. A simple 'make' in the build directory should build embedtool, and create the necessary headers. After changing a png file, a simple make should take care of it all again.


3) A new button theme is much more work:
- Add a directory, populate it with png images. List this directory in $top_src/client/CMakeLists.txt.
- You have to add some logic to the ../client/crystalclient.cpp and ../client/config/configdialog.ui file, to really make your button theme available.



If you made a button theme out of an existing one, please mail it to me (at spam84@nurfuerspam.de), and I'll take care of the proper implementation.
