These are the button themes.

embedtool: Tool wich converts the png files into source code. Make with "make".
Use with 'embedtool file1 file2 > tiles.h', or 'embedtool default/* > tiles.h'. The tiles.h must be included properly, you may overwrite the "tiles.h" in the client subdir.

Recompile crystal and you have your modified buttons used.

Please send me overwhelming button themes. :)
