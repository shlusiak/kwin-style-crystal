These are the button themes for Crystal-GL.

embedtool: Tool wich converts the png files into source code, which is compiled into the decoration. Make with "make".

Use with 'embedtool file1 file2 > tiles.h', or 'embedtool default/*.png > tiles.h'. The tiles.h must be included properly, you may overwrite the "tiles.h" in the client subdir for testing.
Then recompile crystal and you have your modified buttons used.

If you have made a button theme, please mail it to me (at spam84@gmx.de), I'll take care of the proper implementation.
Please send me overwhelming button themes. :)
